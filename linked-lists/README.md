# Linked Lists

Hey everyone, today I am going to show you how to implement a basic linked list in python. A linked list is a data structure that allows you to iterate over a list of nodes where each node points to the next node in the list.

“The principal benefit of a linked list over a conventional array is that the list elements can be easily inserted or removed without reallocation or reorganization of the entire structure because the data items need not be stored contiguously in memory or on disk, while restructuring an array at run-time is a much more expensive operation. Linked lists allow insertion and removal of nodes at any point in the list, and allow doing so with a constant number of operations by keeping the link previous to the link being added or removed in memory during list traversal.”

In this example, we want to highlight the key advantage of using a linked list data structure by implementing our own `insert_at` and `delete_at` methods.

## Output

Running this program will output the following

```
[A B C D]
[A B D]
```
